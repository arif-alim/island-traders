				Otherwise known as “CONSOLIMADATION”, Consolidation is the process of combining multiple
				orders into one so all of your packages will be shipped together. Let’s say you buy a
				smartphone from Amazon and a pair of sneakers from Foot Locker; we will combine both orders
				together to be treated as a single shipment (*FREE of charge) so that you will receive both
				packages together saving you time and money.
