			<p class="mt-2  text-gray-600">
				Otherwise known as “CONSOLIMADATION”, Consolidation is the process of combining multiple
				orders into one so all of your packages will be shipped together. Let’s say you buy a
				smartphone from Amazon and a pair of sneakers from Foot Locker; we will combine both orders
				together to be treated as a single shipment (*FREE of charge) so that you will receive both
				packages together saving you time and money.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-2  text-gray-600">
				Consolidation is offered upon request only. So if your orders are expected to arrive at your
				Unit on different days and from different stores, we will combine them into one shipment for
				you for up to a maximum of ten (10) calendar days.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-2  text-gray-600">
				Please upload your invoices with the tracking numbers to your account to avoid any delays
				with your orders.
